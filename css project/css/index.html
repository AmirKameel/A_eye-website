                      Deployment Model: On-premise software (installed on your own servers) might have a higher upfront cost but potentially lower ongoing fees. Cloud-based software (accessed through a web browser) typically involves a subscription fee.
                      Number of Users: Some software licenses are priced per user, so the more users you need access for, the higher the cost.

                      Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate: This encrypts the data transmission between your web browser and the website, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting it. You can usually identify a secure connection by a lock icon in your browser bar and a URL that starts with "https" instead of "http."
                      PCI Compliance: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure the secure handling of credit card information. Reputable sites will be compliant with PCI DSS to minimize the risk of data breaches.

                      Your comfort level with technology: Do you feel comfortable using technology and learning new things? There's usually a learning curve involved in managing a website, but many platforms are designed to be user-friendly.
                      Time commitment: Managing a website takes time and effort. You'll need to update content, fix any issues, and keep the software up-to-date.

                    <h4>Can We Use Multiple Domain Names / Domains?</h4>
                    <p>
                      This is the simplest method. You set up additional domain names to act as aliases for your primary domain. When someone enters one of these aliases in their browser, they'll be automatically redirected to your main website.
